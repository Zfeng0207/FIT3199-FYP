# Stroke Hero: Interpretable Stroke Monitoring System

This project is a comprehensive system for stroke risk prediction, combining data engineering, machine learning, and web application components. The system processes medical data, particularly ECG signals, to predict stroke risk using advanced deep learning models.

Download the [MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ecg/1.0/) and the [MIMIC-IV dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) (with credentialed access).

## Setup and Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. Run the application:

```bash
python server.py
```

---

## Docker Support

The application can be run using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

---

## Key Features

* ECG signal processing and analysis
* Deep learning-based stroke risk prediction
* Web interface for data upload and results visualization
* Real-time inference capabilities
* Docker containerization for easy deployment

---

## Environment

* Python 3.9+
* Recommended: Linux or macOS
* Minimum 16GB RAM for training deep learning models

---

## Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
* ROC-AUC for binary stroke risk classification
* SHAP values and saliency maps for interpretability

---

## Model Pipeline Overview

* ECG signals are preprocessed using filtering, segmentation, and normalization.
* Deep learning models (e.g., LSTM or 1D CNN) are trained to classify patterns indicative of stroke risk.
* A separate machine learning pipeline is used for vital signs and demographic features.
* Final stroke risk prediction is computed via ensemble or decision logic based on both pipelines.
